# Facet's Drupal 7 Upstream Distribution
"An opinionated Drupal 7 upstream template."

Facet provides Drupal development and maintenance services, and have built our best practices into a series of opinionated configurations that make Drupal developer handoff much easier.

A description of how to use this upstream, and its contents is available here under [Facet's Drupal 7 Best Practices](https://facetinteractive.com/blog/facets-drupal-7-best-practices-checklist?utm_source=github&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=facet-d7-upstream) article.

# @TODO

- Create a *Getting Started* Section.
- Document how to apply upstream updates to downstream forks. 
- Itemize the resources we've included in this project from third-parties.
